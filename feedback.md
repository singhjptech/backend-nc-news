# BE Northcoders NC News Portfolio Check List

Really incredible work Jatinder. Lots of in-depth and good tests and you've made excellent progress on reaching the end of the mandatory endpoints. Your code is mostly consistent throughout and very easy to read. There are a few points below on things you can change and add to the project, but afterwards you can move on to the extra tasks to handle things like DELETE.

## Readme - Remove the one that was provided and write your own

- [ ] Link to hosted version
- [ ] Write a summary of what the project is
- [ ] Provide clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests
- [ ] Include information about how to create `.env.test` and `.env.development` files
- [ ] Specify minimum versions of `Node.js` and `Postgres` needed to run the project

## General

- Stray console.log() in handleInternalServerErrors. Remember to clean up any logs you no longer need

- [~] Remove any unnecessary `console.logs` and comments
- [ ] Remove all unnecessary files (e.g. old `README.md`, `error-handling.md`, `hosting.md`, `./db/utils/README.md` etc.)
- [âœ…] .gitignore the `.env` files

## Connection to db

- [âœ…] Throw error if `process.env.PGDATABASE` is not set

## Creating tables

- Currently, if we delete the articles table, the associated author and comments wouldn't be handled. We can add something during the creation of our table to handle this. You can look at the notes on DELETE for some hints.

- [âœ…] Use `NOT NULL` on required fields
- [âœ…] Default `created_at` in articles and comments tables to the current date:`TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()`
- [ ] Delete all comments when the article they are related to is deleted

## Inserting data

- Very nice logic in formatArticles to handle 'votes'!

- Remember to be consistent with naming things like functions. We have mapTopic, then formatComments. I would argue all these functions are formatting. What do you think?

- [âœ…] Make sure util functions do not mutate data
- [~] Make util functions easy to follow with well named functions and variables
- [âœ…] Test util functions
- [âœ…] Drop tables and create tables in seed function

## Tests

- I'm not sure if you were mid-fix for the code, but you currently have a failing test for /api - responds with JSON object of endpoints. If you are stuck on this test, ask yourself if this test is testing for what you expect.
- With the /api/articles/:article_id, we could test for what happens if a valid number, but non-existent id is passed, resulting in a 404. This test is missing on your patch request for the :article_id endpoint too.
- In the test for 400 - returns with error for new user not setup in database, the status code should be 404 as we have provided valid input, it's just the user cannot be found

- [âœ…] Seeding before each test
- [âœ…] If asserting inside a `forEach`, also has an assertion to check length is at least > 0
- [~] Ensure all tests are passing
- [âœ…] Cover all endpoints and errors

- `GET /api/topics`

  - [âœ…] Status 200, array of topic objects

- `GET /api/articles/:article_id`

  - [âœ…] Status 200, single article object (including `comment_count`)
  - [âœ…] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g. string of "not-an-id"
  - [] Status 404, non existent ID, e.g. 0 or 9999

- `PATCH /api/articles/:article_id`

  - [âœ…] Status 200, updated single article object
  - [âœ…] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g. string of "not-an-id"
  - [ ] Status 404, non existent ID, e.g. 0 or 9999
  - [âœ…] Status 400, missing / incorrect body, e.g. `inc_votes` property is not a number, or missing

- `GET /api/articles`

  - [âœ…] Status 200, array of article objects (including `comment_count`, excluding `body`)
  - [âœ…] Status 200, default sort & order: `created_at`, `desc`
  - [ ] Status 200, accepts `sort_by` query, e.g. `?sort_by=votes`
  - [âœ…] Status 200, accepts `order` query, e.g. `?order=asc`
  - [ ] Status 200, accepts `topic` query, e.g. `?topic=coding`
  - [âœ…] Status 400. invalid `sort_by` query, e.g. `?sort_by=bananas`
  - [âœ…] Status 400. invalid `order` query, e.g. `?order=bananas`
  - [ ] Status 404. non-existent `topic` query, e.g. `?topic=bananas`
  - [âœ…] Status 200. valid `topic` query, but has no articles responds with an empty array of articles, e.g. `?topic=paper`

- `GET /api/articles/:article_id/comments`

  - [âœ…] Status 200, array of comment objects for the specified article
  - [âœ…] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g. string of "not-an-id"
  - [âœ…] Status 404, non existent ID, e.g. 0 or 9999
  - [âœ…] Status 200, valid ID, but has no comments responds with an empty array of comments

- `POST /api/articles/:article_id/comments`

  - [âœ…] Status 201, created comment object
  - [ ] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g. string of "not-an-id"
  - [âœ…] Status 404, non existent ID, e.g. 0 or 9999
  - [âœ…] Status 400, missing required field(s), e.g. no username or body properties
  - [~] Status 404, username does not exist
  - [ ] Status 201, ignores unnecessary properties

- `GET /api`

  - [ ] Status 200, JSON describing all the available endpoints

## Routing

- [âœ…] Split into api, topics, users, comments and articles routers
- [âœ…] Use `.route` for endpoints that share the same path

## Controllers

- Throughout most of your code you are using async await, but in your controllers you are using Promise syntax (.then()) Remember, we should choose one style and stick to it in a project, though it's great to see you can use both ðŸ™‚
- Good use of HTTP methods and database actions for naming of controllers and models

- [âœ…] Name functions and variables well
- [âœ…] Add catch blocks to all model invocations (and don't mix use of`.catch(next);` and `.catch(err => next(err))`)

## Models

- Protected from SQL injection -[âœ…] Using parameterized queries for values in `db.query` e.g `$1` and array of variables
  - [âœ…] Sanitizing any data for tables/columns, e.g. greenlisting when using template literals or pg-format's `%s`
- [âœ…] Consistently use either single object argument _**or**_ multiple arguments in model functions
- [âœ…] Use `LEFT JOIN` for comment counts

## Errors

- Great to see you using Promise.reject in your articles model. This could be extended across all your models for error handling.

- [âœ…] Use error handling middleware functions in app and extracted to separate directory/file
- [~] Consistently use `Promise.reject` in either models _**OR**_ controllers

## Extra Tasks - To be completed after hosting

- `DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id`

- [ ] Status 204, deletes comment from database
- [ ] Status 404, non existant ID, e.g 999
- [ ] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g "not-an-id"

- `GET /api/users`

- [ ] Status 200, responds with array of user objects

- `GET /api/users/:username`

- [ ] Status 200, responds with single user object
- [ ] Status 404, non existant ID, e.g 999
- [ ] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g "not-an-id"

- `PATCH /api/comments/:comment_id`

  - [ ] Status 200, updated single comment object
  - [ ] Status 400, invalid ID, e.g. string of "not-an-id"
  - [ ] Status 404, non existent ID, e.g. 0 or 9999
  - [ ] Status 400, missing / incorrect body, e.g. `inc_votes` property is not a number, or missing

## Extra Advanced Tasks

### Easier

- [ ] Patch: Edit an article body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a comment body
- [ ] Patch: Edit a user's information
- [ ] Get: Search for an article by title
- [ ] Post: add a new user

### Harder

- [ ] Protect your endpoints with JWT authorization. We have notes on this that will help a bit, _but it will make building the front end of your site a little bit more difficult_
- [ ] Get: Add functionality to get articles created in last 10 minutes
- [ ] Get: Get all articles that have been liked by a user. This will require an additional junction table.
- [ ] Research and implement online image storage or random generation of images for topics
